## TOmaDO - Task and Time Management Application
TOmaDO is a Linux-compatible alternative to the popular Focus To-Do application. It was developed to fill the gap for Linux users who need a reliable task and time management tool.
### Motivation
I developed TOmaDO because I was a regular user of the Focus To-Do app, which unfortunately isn't available on Linux platforms. Rather than compromise on productivity, I decided to create my own solution that offers similar functionality while being fully compatible with Linux systems.
